This document presents the specification for “dissimilarity cubes”, a format used to map compositional dissimilarity and turnover of species using occurrence data. It provides a workflow to compile co-occurrence matrices for species in a specified geographic area, source georeferenced environmental data, and map compositional dissimilarity using MS-GDM and zetadiv.

<!-- ## Introduction -->

## Task description

_Task 4.2, lead: SUN_

Design workflows to compile a co-occurrence matrix for species in a geographic area, source georeferenced environmental data, and map compositional dissimilarity using ‘MS-GDM', 'zetadiv', and 'SSDM' R packages. This includes identifying bioregions and predicting future compositional turnover and bioregion shifts.
